            <h2>Industry Readiness Program</h2>
            <p>Touched on in the presentation, the Industry Readiness Program is one of the best parts about being in Minnovate</p>
          </div>
          <p>The Minnovate Industry Readiness Program seeks to equip students with the skills most important and common to engineering fields, recognizing the importance of both technical and non-technical.  Here's how it works:</p>
            <li>Held over the course of the spring semester.
            <li>Groups meet once a week for 2 hours in the Anderson Student Innovation Lab.
            <li>Students are grouped into teams and have the entire semester to design a prototype.
            <li>Students receive certification from Anderson Labs on their transcripts.
            <li>Students build technical, teamwork, and communication skills in a hands-on project
            <li>Program culminates with a final presentation in front of head of Design at Anderson Labs and other program members!
