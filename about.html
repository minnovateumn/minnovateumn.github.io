            <h1>HOW MINNOVATE WORKS</h1>
          </div>
          <p>Each semester, our group puts on the following events:</p>
            <li>Brainstorming Event: No idea is a bad idea! Get in a creative mindset and get practice using a common brainstorming method useful for senior design or any problem solving.
            <li>Networking Event: Industry professionals connect with students in a relaxed atmosphere, keeping students up to date with industry trends.
            <li>Innovation Challenge: We want to promote a culture of innovators and entrepreneurs at the U. Through real-world prompts, participants will design an idea that can help solve real problems facing society today.
            <li>Industry Readiness Program (Spring only): Classes won't teach you everything you need to know for your future career. In weekly meetings, students develop a product idea and turn it into a prototype, simultaneously learning skills that will prepare them for work post-graduation.
            <li> Any other event: Tell us what you want to see or what would be helpful to you!
        </li>

                <p>Joining Minnovate will help prepare you for the <a href="https://minnovationchallenge.weebly.com/">Innovation Challenge</a>, a friendly competition that happens each semester. Each iteration of the Innovation Challenge focuses on three or four new prompts. Students, working individually or in groups, choose a prompt and spend a few weeks designing a solution, which they will then present to a panel of industry professionals on (friendly) competition night. Past years have had focus in healthcare, app development, industrial engineering, and sustainability.</p> </div>
